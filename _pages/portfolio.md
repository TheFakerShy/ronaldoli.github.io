## Some of My Projects Currently Ongoing & Have Done

### Cornell Sustainable Design (CUSD) -- Sustainable Education

- **Ongoing project and actively participating.** Project advisor: Prof. Sirietta Simoncini
- Developed skills in project management, stakeholder management, and cross-functional collaboration while working on the project. Enhanced data analysis skills by analyzing various factors affecting sustainable education in Nepal, such as environmental, social, and economic factors.
- Conducted detailed analysis of the conditions in Nepal to determine the suitability for sustainable education, leading to the development of a series of sustainability acts.
- Collaborated with sub-teams focusing on different aspects, such as sustainability and budget, to develop a near-to-full self-sustainable and budget-friendly school for promoting sustainable education.
- Collaborated with the whole team to construct an overall detailed and formal project report that has been approved by the Systems Engineering department as well as tended to the stakeholders.
- Formulated and developed revisions of current project reports, plans, design initiatives, and sustainability factors to maximize the confidence interval of optimizing sustainable education for the Nepal school.

### Pedestrian Greenway Optimization System

- **Have just completed the project.** For the course SYSEN 5400. Instructors: [Prof. Oliver Gao](https://www.gao-systematics.com/group "GAO Systematics") (or check out his other [link](https://gao.cee.cornell.edu/)) & [Dr. Tim Fraser](https://timothyfraser.com/)
- Identified potential metrics that would affect the outcome of decisions towards building a satisfactory pedestrian greenway system.
- Analyzed stakeholders, decisions, reference options, alternatives, as well as features accordingly.
- Proposed a potential system with a calculated architectural tradespace size of **8,847,360 solutions**.
- Enumerated partially with the architectures with random generation n = 10,000.
- Using concepts of Pareto Fronts, Fuzzy Paretoes, Utility Metrics and so on to populate and visualize all and selected region of architectures for further analyzation.
- Conducted lift, supp and confidence calculations to yield sensitivity and connectivity relations relatively.
- Proposed patterns that shall lead to good architectures and concluded discussions for findings and potential future developments.
