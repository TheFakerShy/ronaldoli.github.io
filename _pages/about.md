### Current Cornell Systems Engineering M.Eng Student


> “Knowledge gives us a compass, but kindness is what gets us down the road. And to quote an African proverb that one of my mentors was fond of sharing, ‘If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.’”    -- Cornell President Pollack on the New Student Convocation Speech on Aug. 25, 2021
